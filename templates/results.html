                                The item from the list goes through a while loop that is run as long as the item
                                is still in string form. The item is first checked if it is an empty string,
                                which then instructs the interpreter to return -1, the error value. After that,
                                the item is parsed; if parsing fails, string stripping/cleaning is done to the
                                value and then the process repeats.
                            </p>

                                If there is nothing in the list or the list is empty, the value is expected to

                                Every item in the list is stripped (on both ends) of whitespaces and
                                punctuation, and then is compared to each certain baseline statement under the
                                job field (category: e.g, services, healthcare, engineering, etc.). These
                                baseline statements are <span class="fw-bold">synthesized experience statements
                                </span> of professionals and experts in the job field their resume fits into,
                                generated through ChatGPT.

                                So essentially, this feature determines <span class="fst-italic">how
                                    professional/expert-sounding the applicant's experiences are.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The comparison is undergone between each item in the feature and each item
                                in the baseline statements under the certain job field. This process uses
                                <span class="fw-bold">ELMo</span>, a language embedding model that
                                expresses words in vectors that is supposed to vary according to the words
                                surrounding it in the sentence. The vectors of the item in the feature and
                                the single baseline statement are further compressed via the
                                <span class="fst-italic">mean</span> function to express the vector of the
                                statements as a whole, and compared to each other using the
                                <span class="fw-bold">cosine similarity</span> strategy; a value
                                closer to -1 means less similarity in meaning and definition, and a value
                                closer to 1 means more similarity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, the way to determine this feature's numeric value is by determining
                                which is the calculated <span class="fw-bold">maximum</span> value in all of
                                the items in the feature. The logic for this is that an applicant could have a
                                wide range of experiences; simply taking the mean of all of their experiences
                                could drastically make their professionalism/expertise seem lower, which is
                                why we have resorted to getting the maximum instead.
                            </p>

                                considering how resume parsing and configuration has been implemented.

                                To get the final value of this feature, it is checked according to the
                                list of constants as created by the team for valid degrees (programs).
                                Whatever item in the list of values has a match first in the list of
                                accepted/supported degrees (programs), it automatically becomes the final
                                value of the feature, with the rest discarded.

                                The checking of the value supports two options: one is for complete form and
                                the other for abbreviated form. Every value in the feature is first split into
                                words and then converted to lowercase. When every word matches every token of
                                a degree (program) constant, the label for that degree becomes the value of the
                                feature. If matching fails in word form, abbreviated form is matched after which
                                also determines the final value of the feature if match is successful.

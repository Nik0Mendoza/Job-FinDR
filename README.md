# Job Role Finder

Made as part of a final requirement of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines' Computer Science course.

## PREPROCESSING Changes

The `preprocessing` directory has been removed. This is to ensure uniformity across the project (as well as to satisfy my OCD--HEHE).

To acquire the package, refer to this [link](https://github.com/conraduouou/job-findr-preprocessing), which will contain the steps in installation.
